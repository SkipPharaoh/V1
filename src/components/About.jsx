                <h1> <u>About Me</u> </h1>

                <p>Hello, most of my friends call me Skip and I'm a recent graduate of General Assembly's full-time software engineering immersive Bootcamp. I have a passion and tenacity for problem-solving, which feeds my creativity.</p>

                <p>My interest for software developing start when I came across Google's courses available on Coursera. That led me to take a course available on Coursera by MIT called 'Python For Everyone.' Fast-forward to taday, and I've had the privilege of building and exploring some of the many tools available to software developers.</p>

                <p>I am curious and motivated to learn as much as I can to strengthen my problem-solving skill, which will result in becoming a better developer.</p>

                <p>Checkout my skills and projects below!</p>
